# Jurisdiction Checklist for 2020

## Capture Historical Data
- [ ] Record source and format (flat file? api?) of historical files in `remark.txt` (or note if unavailable)
- [ ] Download 2016 (primary & general), 2018 (primary & general) and 2020 primary elections. For each file, note file creation date and download date.

## Munge Historical Data
- [ ] Create jurisdiction files
- [ ] Create munger files (more than one munger may be necessary)
- [ ] Load data to common database

## Create Nov 4, 2020 Plan
- [ ] Determine how election results will be published during the canvass. This information may be available from the State Board of Elections; if not, others may provide insights -- political groups, election integrity activists, other election data collectors (e.g., that state's owner in OpenElections.net). Record possible sources (even if they turn out to be dead ends) and information gleaned in `remark.txt`
